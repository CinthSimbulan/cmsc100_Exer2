Steps to create a github page:
  1. Create a new public repository with the name username.github.io and it is strict that you use your username or else it will not work
  2. Clone the repository
  3. Go to the folder, then add an html file for example: echo "Hello World" > index.html
  4. Modify the html file, then add, commit, and finally push to the remote repository
  5. Open a browser and go to username.github.io. You might need to wait some time before the website becomes live
Key takeaways:
-Conceptualize and imagine how you want the website to look like.
-Be PATIENT in trying to achieve the desired concept.
-Learn to experiment on what features would best fit the website.
-Lastly, I realized that there are so many syntax for HTML and CSS and I must learn to explore so that I have more options to play with.
